# Portfolio

The HTML file includes overview of projects worked on as part of the MIT xPRO Professional Certificate in Coding: Full Stack Development with MERN.
Some of the assignment had basic codes or styling, and we had to adjust / code specific sections. 
Most of the assignment was based on completing the web application by writing the necessary Javascript code vs. styling.
However, I also created my own from scratch, except for the NavBar that I imported from Bootstrap for extra credit.

## Installation

Download the Zip file on this [link](https://github.com/tlswodnjs/tlswodnjs.github.io/archive/refs/heads/main.zip) to access the different files. 
One can also reference [bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.0/components/navs-tabs/) for guidelines around the NavBar and importing the right code.

## Roadmap

In the future, I will continue to add updates based on the projects that I work on throughout the course.
The goal is to build an outline from scratch, so I will continue to test out different formatting / styling + html structuring throughout the course.
I am also planning to work on a side project that keeps track of the stock market and recommends ~20 stocks to consider each day based on key indicatiors.

## Contributing

Feel free to adjust as you see fit, but the assignments belong to MIT. Further, some of the material is imported from bootstrap.
