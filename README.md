# Portfolio

The HTML file includes overview of projects worked on as part of the MIT xPRO Professional Certificate in Coding: Full Stack Development with MERN.
Some of the assignment had basic codes or styling, and we had to adjust / code specific sections. 
Most of the assignment was based on completing the web application by writing the necessary Javascript code vs. styling.
However, I also created my own from scratch, except for the NavBar that I imported from Bootstrap for extra credit.

## Installation

Download the Zip file on this [link](https://github.com/tlswodnjs/tlswodnjs.github.io/archive/refs/heads/main.zip) to access the different files. 
One can also reference via [bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.0/components/navs-tabs/).

## Roadmap

In the future, I am planning to add more information on the specific bus like bus#, number of disrespectfulness to Asian or Black?
